Writing an about me seems to be harder than what I Imagined it would be...&nbsp; &nbsp; I am an 48 year old world traveler, father to a 12 year old teenager daughter, spend half his life working &amp; living abroad in APAC, MEA, CIS , Europe and lastly for the last 8 years in United States. During all these years I have held and still holding senior management roles in several worldwide known TECH companies... Our interest in Destin started right after we moved to USA in 2016 and purchased our first condo for vacation rental&nbsp; in 2020 followed with our latest one in December 2023... When we first visited our condo in 2020 (yes we have seen Destin and our condo after we purchased it 😊 ) we really realized our decision was so correct. Being in all around the world I can honesty say Destin&nbsp; will be in my top 3 locations for a holiday...&nbsp; The white &amp; sandy beaches, the ocean view from the balcony, hearing the waves with no city sound around was nothing but soul resting... &nbsp; So why did we decide to&nbsp; have a website after all? &nbsp; While we are an Airbnb super host with 4.94 average and we still list our units Airbnb &amp; VRBO, we have received so many questions from our past guests if they can book directly with us and finally we decided , why not to give it a try...

      "content": "Destin Getaways Condos by LC&#39;s Do You Need a Car in Destin Florida? 2025 Guide to Rentals &amp; Tips Posted on February 13, 2024 Destin useful information Nestled along Florida&rsquo;s Emerald Coast, Destin offers sugar-white beaches, charming coastal towns, and endless attractions. One common traveler question is: Do you need a rental car in Destin? The answer depends on your itinerary, budget, and travel style. This guide covers when a rental car makes sense, when it doesn&rsquo;t, and the best alternatives. 🚗 Why You Might Need a Rental Car in Destin Freedom to Explore Destin and its nearby towns (Seaside, Miramar Beach, Grayton Beach) are filled with hidden gems. A rental car lets you go beyond the main strip and explore at your own pace. Convenience for Attractions From grocery runs to popular stops like Henderson Beach State Park or the Gulfarium Marine Adventure Park , a car makes it much easier to get around. Flexibility for Day Trips A rental car allows you to take spontaneous drives along Highway 98 , explore nearby state parks, or head out for fishing and boating excursions without depending on rideshares. Comfort in the Heat With summer temperatures climbing into the 90s, an air-conditioned car can make sightseeing far more comfortable. 🏖️ When You Don&rsquo;t Need a Rental Car in Destin Beachfront Stays If you&rsquo;re staying near the beach, you may not need a car at all. Many resorts and hotels are within walking distance of restaurants, shops, and beach access . Parking Challenges Parking at popular spots like HarborWalk Village can be limited or cost $10&ndash;$20/day . Skipping a car avoids that hassle. Traffic Congestion Highway 98 can get congested in peak season. Bikes, scooters, or rideshares often move around quicker in busy areas. Cost Savings Rental cars in Destin usually range from $100&ndash;$150 per day in peak season , and $35&ndash;$60/day off-season . If you&rsquo;re only staying for a few days and plan to stay local, rideshares may be more cost-effective. Eco-Friendly Choice Skipping a car lowers your carbon footprint &mdash; a plus if you prefer sustainable travel. 🚲 Alternatives to Rental Cars in Destin Uber &amp; Lyft &ndash; Widely available, expect $15&ndash;$25 per ride locally . Bikes &amp; Scooters &ndash; Fun and eco-friendly, usually $20&ndash;$30/day . Hotel Shuttles &ndash; Many resorts provide free or low-cost shuttles to beaches and attractions. Walking &ndash; If you&rsquo;re near Harbor or the beach district, much of Destin is walkable. Option Avg. Cost Best For Downsides Rental Car $100&ndash;$150/day (peak), $35&ndash;$60/day (off-season) Families, day trips, flexibility Parking, traffic Uber/Lyft $15&ndash;$25/ride (off-season) Short trips, couples Adds up quickly Bike/Scooter $20&ndash;$30/day Eco-friendly beach hopping Limited range Hotel Shuttle Free&ndash;$10/trip Airport, local attractions Limited routes ✅ Final Verdict: Do You Need a Car in Destin? If your trip is mainly beach-focused and your hotel is central, you can skip the car and rely on rideshares or walking. But if you want to explore beyond Destin, shop, or take day trips , a rental car gives you the freedom and flexibility to do it all. 👉 Pro tip: Check booking sites like Expedia, Kayak, or directly with local agencies &mdash; rates swing heavily by season. ❓ FAQs Is Uber available in Destin, Florida? Yes. Uber and Lyft operate throughout Destin. Expect $15&ndash;$25 per ride locally. How much does it cost to rent a car in Destin for a week? On average, $250&ndash;$450 off-season and $500&ndash;$750 peak season , depending on car type and demand. Do most hotels in Destin include parking?
